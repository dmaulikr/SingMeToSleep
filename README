Sing Me to Sleep is designed to play music for a pre-determined time and then fade into white noise for eight hours.  It functions as a clock and shows the weather for today and tomorrow for zipcode that the iDevice is in when the app is started.

I began this project as an attempt to learn Objective C.  I've been a Java developer for a number of years and I have wanted to code for the iPad/iPhone for a while.  If there are any developers out there interested in working on bug fixes or enhancements for this app send me an email at flynx42 at me dot com.

This code is freely available for noncomercial purposes.  I hope that my experiements in Objective C can help others.  This app is in an Alpha version and currently is only marginally stable.  The Alarms should not be used as your sole mechinism for waking up, until you have thouroughly tested for memory leaks (in other words if your late for work or school, its not my fault, you have been warned).

Enjoy and happy coding!
